# Length Calculator

Length calculator is an code dojo project.

## Requirement

0. Always keeps code clean & tidy.
1. Metric length can be represented.
2. Length can be compared.
3. Length support arithmetic operations.
4. Imperial length can be represented, same as metric length.

## TODO

If future Scala supports implicit type conversion to Dynamic,
refactor `Number2Meter` class extends Dynamic, and use DSL to
describe supported units.
